Notice that $\\overline{X}^TV$ would give a matrix of shape (D, N) but the eigenvectors beyond the Dth column will have eigenvalues of 0, so it is safe to drop any columns beyond the D'th dimension. \n","    2. Also note that the columns of $U$ will not be unit-length if we pre-multiply $V$ with $\\overline{X}^T$, so we will have to normalize the columns of $U$ so that they have unit-length to be consistent with the `PCA` implementation above.\n","5.
